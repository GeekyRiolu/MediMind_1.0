## Features
The **Clinic Agent** is the core feature of MediMind, designed to assist healthcare professionals in processing and analyzing patient EHR data. Hereâ€™s what it can do:

- **Process EHR Data**: Analyze patient Electronic Health Records (EHR) to extract key insights.
- **Generate Medical Advice**: Provide actionable medical advice based on the patientâ€™s EHR data.
- **Summarize Patient Data**: Create concise summaries of patient histories, diagnoses, and treatment plans.
- **Sanitize PHI**: Remove or anonymize Protected Health Information (PHI) to ensure compliance with privacy regulations.
- **Interactive Interface**: A user-friendly interface for healthcare professionals to interact with the Clinic Agent.

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GeekyRiolu/MediMind_1.0.git
cd MediMind_1.0
```

---

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment
Create a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

---

### Step 3: Activate the Virtual Environment
Activate the virtual environment:

- **On Windows**:
  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- **On macOS/Linux**:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

Once activated, your terminal prompt should change to indicate the virtual environment is active.

---

### Step 4: Install Requirements
Install the required Python packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### Step 5: Run the Application
Start the FastAPI application by running the following command: (landing page)

```bash
cd MediMind_1.0
uvicorn fastapi_app:app --reload 
```
For Running Chatbot UI directly:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Run the dockerized app:

```bash
docker build -t medimind-app .
docker run -p 8001:8000 -p 8501:8501 medimind-app
```
